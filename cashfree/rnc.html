        <h2>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Last updated on:</strong> 20-03-2025 18:55:12</p>
        <p>JANARTHANAN SUBANANTHAM believes in helping its customers as far as possible and has a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the shipping process.</li>
            <li>JANARTHANAN SUBANANTHAM does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, a refund or replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not good.</li>
            <li>In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request will be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at their own end. This should be reported within 7 days of receipt of the product.</li>
            <li>If the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service within 7 days of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team will review the complaint and take an appropriate decision.</li>
            <li>For complaints regarding products that come with a manufacturerâ€™s warranty, please refer the issue to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>In case of any refunds approved by JANARTHANAN SUBANANTHAM, it will take 6-8 days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.</li>
        </ul>
