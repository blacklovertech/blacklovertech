    <h1>Privacy Policy for COVID-19 Stats App</h1>

    <p>Effective Date: April 20, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you for using the COVID-19 Stats app. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information. We are committed to ensuring your privacy and data security.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>This app **does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII)** from its users. We do not ask for or store your:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Address</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Phone number</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage patterns within the app (beyond basic session information for error reporting, if any)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app primarily functions by fetching and displaying publicly available COVID-19 statistics from the disease.sh API. This data is aggregated and does not contain individual user information.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>As we **do not collect any personal information**, we do not use your personal data for any purpose.</p>
    <p>The app uses publicly available data to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display global and country-specific COVID-19 statistics.</li>
        <li>Provide links to official health organization websites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Since we **do not collect any personal information**, we do not share any personal data with third parties.</p>
    <p>The app interacts with the disease.sh API to retrieve publicly accessible data. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of this third-party API provider. Please refer to their privacy policy if you have any concerns about their data handling.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the security of the app and the integrity of the data displayed. However, as we **do not store any personal information on our servers or on your device beyond the app installation itself**, the risks associated with data breaches of personal data are minimal.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is intended for a general audience and **does not knowingly collect any information from children**. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so that we can take appropriate action (as we don't collect such data, this scenario is highly unlikely).</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the effective date will be updated accordingly. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer at: <a href="https://github.com/blacklovertech">https://github.com/blacklovertech</a> (This is a contact method, not a data collection point within the app itself).</p>
