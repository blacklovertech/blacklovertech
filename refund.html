    <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated on 16-12-2024 13:56:05</strong></p>

    <p><strong>SUBANANTHAM JANARTHANAN</strong> believes in helping its customers as far as possible and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>

    <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.</li>
            <li>SUBANANTHAM JANARTHANAN does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not good.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>2. Damaged or Defective Products</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at his own end. This should be reported within 7 days of receipt of the products.</li>
            <li>If you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our Customer Service team within 7 days of receiving the product. The Customer Service team will then take an appropriate decision based on the complaint.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>3. Products with Manufacturerâ€™s Warranty</h2>
        <p>In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue directly to them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>4. Refund Processing</h2>
        <p>In case of any refunds approved by <strong>SUBANANTHAM JANARTHANAN</strong>, it will take 6-8 days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.</p>
    </div>
